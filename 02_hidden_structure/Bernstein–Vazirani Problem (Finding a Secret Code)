The Story

Imagine:

The computer has a secret binary string, like:
s = 101101

You don’t know s

You can only ask questions to a black box

The black box computes:

f(x) = x · s   (bitwise dot product, mod 2)


Don’t worry about the formula — think of it as:

The function hides a secret code.

Classical Computer

To find all bits of s:

Needs n questions (one per bit)

Quantum Computer

Using superposition:

Learns all bits of the secret at once

👉 Needs just ONE query

😲 Huge speedup!

Key Lesson

Quantum computers can extract hidden information in parallel.
