This one is very important historically.

The Problem

There is a secret string s (not all zeros).

The function has this rule:

f(x) = f(x ⊕ s)


That means:

Every output is produced by two different inputs

Those two inputs differ by s

Your job:
👉 Find the secret string s

Classical Computer

Needs exponential time

Gets slower very fast as input size grows

Quantum Computer

Uses superposition + measurements

Each run gives partial information

After a few runs, you can solve for s

👉 Needs polynomial time

⚡ Exponential speedup!

Why Simon’s Problem Is Important

Simon’s algorithm was the first proof that quantum computers can be exponentially faster than classical ones.

It directly inspired Shor’s algorithm (which breaks RSA encryption).
