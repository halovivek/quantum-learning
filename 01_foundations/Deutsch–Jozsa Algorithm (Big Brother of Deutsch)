What Changed?

Instead of 1-bit input, now:

Input can be many bits (000… to 111…)

Function is still either:

CONSTANT (same output for all inputs)

BALANCED (half outputs 0, half outputs 1)

Classical Computer

Worst case:

You may need to check more than half of all inputs

If input size is big → very slow

Quantum Computer

Using:

Superposition (all inputs at once)

Interference (canceling wrong answers)

👉 Only ONE run of the quantum circuit
👉 Guaranteed correct answer

Key Lesson

Quantum computers can detect global patterns very efficiently.
