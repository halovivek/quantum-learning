# 👋 Hi, I’m Vivek Rajagopalan

I’m a technology leader transitioning into **applied quantum computing**,
with a focus on **quantum algorithms, hybrid optimization, and real hardware execution**.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On
- Quantum algorithms (Deutsch, Grover, Shor, QAOA)
- Classical vs quantum performance benchmarking
- Hybrid quantum–classical optimization
- IBM Quantum real-hardware execution
- Cryptography and post-quantum security impact

---

## 🧪 Featured Quantum Projects
- **Visualizing Quantum Advantage in Oracle Problems**
- **Grover vs Classical Search Performance (with noise & hardware)**
- **Hybrid Optimization with QAOA**
- **Shor’s Algorithm and Cryptography Impact**

👉 See my full quantum portfolio here:
**[Quantum Computing Portfolio](./Quantum_Portfolio_Index.ipynb)**

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Qiskit
- IBM Quantum
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Hybrid optimization workflows

---

## 🎯 Philosophy
Quantum computing is not a replacement for classical systems.
It is a specialized accelerator that must be applied **carefully, honestly,
and with realistic expectations**.
