The Problem (In Simple Words)

    You are given a black box function (you don’t know how it works).

The function:

            Takes one bit (0 or 1)

            Gives one bit as output

You are told:

The function is either
                      CONSTANT → always gives the same output
                      OR
                      BALANCED → gives different outputs for 0 and 1

Your Goal

👉 Find out which type it is.

                            To be sure:
                            
                            Test input 0
                            
                            Test input 1

                              A quantum computer:
                              
                              Tries 0 and 1 at the same time using superposition
                              
                              Uses interference to combine results

👉 Needs only 1 check

                                🎉 That’s the magic!

Key Lesson from Deutsch’s Algorithm

                        Quantum computers can sometimes solve problems with fewer steps than classical ones.
